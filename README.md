# sql-challenge

In the following challenge, I sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) to provide visual relationships between the six CSV files provided. I used QuickDBD to sketch the ERD and W3 schools and classwork examples to better understand the constraints and how to best use them. I saved and attached the ERD to this repo and named it "Entity Relationship Diagram"

Once I sketched the ERD, I completed the data analysis portion using the six CSV files provided. Firstly, I created six tables, defined data types and constraints for each column, and imported the corresponding data from the CSV files. Once the data was imported I than started my analysis using functions like join, where clauses, group bys and order bys. I created a csv file for each analysis question and save it in the images folder in this repo. In addition, I created two queries, one called "TableInsert" which contains code for creating and displaying the tables and a second query called "data" containing code for the analysis portion of this challenge.
